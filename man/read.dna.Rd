\title{Read DNA Sequences in a File}
\description{
  These functions read DNA sequences in a file, and returns a matrix or a
  list of DNA sequences with the names of the taxa read in the file as
  rownames or names, respectively. By default, the sequences are stored
  in binary format, otherwise (if \code{as.character = TRUE}) in lower
  case.
}
\usage{
read.dna(file, format = "interleaved", skip = 0,
         nlines = 0, comment.char = "#",
         as.character = FALSE, as.matrix = NULL)
read.FASTA(file)
}
\arguments{
  \item{file}{a file name specified by either a variable of mode character,
    or a double-quoted string.}
  \item{format}{a character string specifying the format of the DNA
    sequences. Four choices are possible: \code{"interleaved"},
    \code{"sequential"}, \code{"clustal"}, or \code{"fasta"}, or any
    unambiguous abbreviation of these.}
  \item{skip}{the number of lines of the input file to skip before
    beginning to read data (ignored for FASTA files; see below).}
  \item{nlines}{the number of lines to be read (by default the file is
    read untill its end; ignored for FASTA files)).}
  \item{comment.char}{a single character, the remaining of the line
    after this character is ignored (ignored for FASTA files).}
  \item{as.character}{a logical controlling whether to return the
    sequences as an object of class \code{"DNAbin"} (the default).}
  \item{as.matrix}{(used if \code{format = "fasta"}) one of the three
    followings: (i) \code{NULL}: returns the sequences in a matrix if
    they are of the same length, otherwise in a list; (ii) \code{TRUE}:
    returns the sequences in a matrix, or stops with an error if they
    are of different lengths; (iii) \code{FALSE}: always returns the
    sequences in a list.}
}
\details{
  \code{read.dna} follows the interleaved and sequential formats defined
  in PHYLIP (Felsenstein, 1993) but with the original feature than there
  is no restriction on the lengths of the taxa names. For these two
  formats, the first line of the file must contain the dimensions of the
  data (the numbers of taxa and the numbers of nucleotides); the
  sequences are considered as aligned and thus must be of the same
  lengths for all taxa. For the FASTA format, the conventions defined in
  the URL below (see References) are followed; the sequences are taken as
  non-aligned. For all formats, the nucleotides can be arranged in any
  way with blanks and line-breaks inside (with the restriction that the
  first ten nucleotides must be contiguous for the interleaved and
  sequential formats, see below). The names of the sequences are read in
  the file. Particularities for each format are detailed below.

\itemize{
  \item{Interleaved:}{the function starts to read the sequences after it
    finds one or more spaces (or tabulations). All characters before the
    sequences are taken as the taxa names after removing the leading and
    trailing spaces (so spaces in taxa names are allowed). It is assumed
    that the taxa names are not repeated in the subsequent blocks of
    nucleotides.}

  \item{Sequential:}{the same criterion than for the interleaved format
    is used to start reading the sequences and the taxa names; the
    sequences are then read until the number of nucleotides specified in
    the first line of the file is reached. This is repeated for each taxa.}

  \item{Clustal:}{this is the format output by the Clustal programs
    (.aln). It is somehow similar to the interleaved format: the
    differences being that the dimensions of the data are not indicated
    in the file, and the names of the sequences are repeated in each block.}

  \item{FASTA:}{This looks like the sequential format but the taxa names
    (or rather a description of the sequence) are on separate lines
    beginning with a `greater than' character `>' (there may be
    leading spaces before this character). These lines are taken as taxa
    names after removing the `>' and the possible leading and trailing
    spaces. All the data in the file before the first sequence is ignored.}
}}
\value{
  a matrix or a list (if \code{format = "fasta"}) of DNA sequences
  stored in binary format, or of mode character (if \code{as.character =
    "TRUE"}).

  \code{read.FASTA} always returns a list of class \code{"DNAbin"}.
